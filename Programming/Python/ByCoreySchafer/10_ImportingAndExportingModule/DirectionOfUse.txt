Mymodule.py is the module created which has function like find_index which finds index and we can use that
if we call this module by importing the Mymodule as a module.

If this python file is present in the current path then you can directly import this module otherwise need 
to use the os to check Current Working Directory and sys to append the path where module is present and 
then you can use the module.
