Admin page is the great way to see the nice GUI for creating updating or deleting data present at: localhost:8000/admin

to create a superuser login to admin page
go to the location where manage.py is present in the command prompt

python manage.py createsuperuser

we got the error for above code like at last line shows hint
no such table: auth_user 

means haven't created the database table for project. so need to run the few migration command which apply changes to the database 
one migration command will create the database and add a bunch of default tables for us and this auth_user is one of those tables that is going to get created

python manage.py makemigrations
its output: No changes detected

python manage.py migrate

output
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0001_initial... OK

Now lets create the superuser by the command

python manage.py createsuperuser

output:
Username (leave blank to use 'kiran'): newUserKiran
Email address: userKiran123@gmail.com
Password: 
Password (again):
12345678asd
Superuser created successfully.

now run the server by 

python manage.py runserver

go to the http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

Username: newUserKiran
Password: 12345678asd

which leads to the site administration having groups and users
click on the word groups which shows 0 groups 
we you click on the Authentication and Authorization(Home > Authentication and Authorization > group) then we go back to the 
Authentication and Authorization
if you click on the Users we get the username newUserKiran
if you click on the username newUserKiran we get more details

now click on the Users between (Authentication and Authorization) and newUserKiran 
we can actually add the user when you click on the top right corner where we have ADD USER with plus sign

click on the ADD USER 
Provide the username, password and password confirmation
and after that click on the save and continue editing button
provide email, staff status means that this person at the bottm we also have the access to delete this new user. Save.

My action says about what changes we have done to the users plus sign says that we have created the user pencil icon for the editing the user and added their email address
