Go to the App1(app folder) -> views.py where we have the dummy data post like 
posts = [
    {
        'name': 'Author1',
        'title': 'title1',
        'date_posted': 'June 5, 2024',
        'content': 'This is content 1.'
    },
    {
        'name': 'Author2',
        'title': 'title2',
        'date_posted': 'June 2, 2024',
        'content': 'This is content 2.'
    }
]

so lets add the post data instead so lets import post by
from .models import Post

and change the context which is present in the home
context = {
	'posts': Post.objects.all()
}

in the home.html change post.name as post.author as from the previous part10 

dates is not in the same format as the dummy data
formatting link: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/templates/builtins/#date

go to the home.html in the templates folder 
<small class="text-muted">{{ post.date_posted }}</small>
will be changed to 
<small class="text-muted">{{ post.date_posted|date:"F d, Y" }}</small>

now there no need to use the dummy data variable like posts list of dictionaries

now go to App1(startapp folder) -> admin.py
this is where we can register our models and they can show up in the admin page we need to import the model by
from .models import Post

and now to register this model with our admin site we use the code
admin.site.register(Post)

now go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
and reload that then we will get 
Posts in the APP1
click on the Posts letter then we will get all the posts and click on that posts where we get all the data
then we can manually change the data for all the posts and we can also change the author this changes also shows on the home page
