#A single project can have multiple apps
#Stay where the manage.py is present 
#Now to start the app we can use the command 
python manage.py startapp app_start1

#Now go to -> app_start1 -> views.py
#Create the function which handles the traffic from the home page of the
#blog app(app_start1) this function is going to take the request argument 
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse 
#Create your views here.
def home(request):
    return HttpResponse('<h1>Blog Home</h1>')

Now within the blog app directory(app_start1) we are going to create a new file 
and I am going to the urls.py which is similar to the urls.py in the 
django_project which has
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
so in the urls.py of app_start1 write the code as
from django.urls import path 
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
from . import views: where . means it is from the current directory

#In the app_start1 modified urls
from django.urls import path 
from . import views 
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name = "blog-home"),
]

#Now in the django_project urls
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
#Modified portions
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('blog/', include('app_start1.urls')),
]

#Now adding the about page
#Adding the about function in the app_start1 views
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse 
# Create your views here.
def home(request):
    return HttpResponse('<h1>Blog Home</h1>')
def about(request):
    return HttpResponse('<h1>Blog About</h1>')
#Updating the app urls
from django.urls import path 
from . import views 
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name = "blog-home"),
    path('about', views.about, name = "blog-about"),
]
#Updating the project urls
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('blog/', include('app_start1.urls')),
]
